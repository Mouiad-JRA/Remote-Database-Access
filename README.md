# Remote-Database-Access
Develop a distributed program that provides the service of accessing and reading from a remote database
(either reading a line, several lines, a column, or several columns) and presenting 
it to remote customers using distributed software technologies.

# Develop a full distributed program using .NET Remoting & SQL server
 Providing data from the remote database (on the server side) to the clients requesting it:

a. Clients need to specify the SQL commands needed

b. Server remotely access the database and return the needed data and send it back to client.

c. The client prints out the received data. The server is locally hosted on the same machine as the client

# What we deliver:
1- The full code of a simple distributed program, with an executable version.

2- we have three separate parts: the interface, the server, and the client.

3- A report discussing the main features in the code (code explanation) and the detailed steps for the question2.
